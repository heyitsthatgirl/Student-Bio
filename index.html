        Hi! My name is Hope. I'm a Charlotte native living on the East side with my husband, our son, and our two dogs. My interests include drinking coffee, reading, drinking coffee while reading, roller skating, and pro-wrestling.

      <p class="indent">
        I first took an interest in web development in 2015 after helping a friend figure out how to fix broken links on
        her website. I've considered applying to the full-stack coding bootcamp THREE separate times since then, but always
        talked myself out of it. I just didn't think I was "techie" enough. After exploring other career paths (and not falling in love with any of them) I am finally here and ready to
        commit myself to coding!
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        I look forward to seeing where this new path takes me. Cheers! â˜•
